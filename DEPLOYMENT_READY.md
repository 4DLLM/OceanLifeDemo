# Ocean Life Yacht Services - Image Fix Complete! üéâ

## What We Fixed

### ‚úÖ Updated Files
1. **FleetPage.jsx** - Fixed 6 yacht vessel images to use proper paths
2. **PlatformPage.jsx** - Fixed 3 dashboard screenshot images to use proper paths
3. **AboutPage.jsx** - Fixed paths (but this page is not used and contains wrong content)

### ‚úÖ Already Working
- HomePage.jsx ‚úì
- GalleryPage.jsx ‚úì
- ServicesPage.jsx ‚úì
- Header.jsx (logo) ‚úì

## Important Notes

1. **AboutPage.jsx is not used** - It contains content about "Ohio Goldendoodles" which is from a different project. It's not linked in the navigation or routes, so it won't affect the site.

2. **All active pages now use the correct image paths** for GitHub Pages deployment.

## To Deploy These Changes

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# Make the deploy script executable
chmod +x deploy_image_fixes.sh

# Run the deploy script (this will commit, push, and build)
./deploy_image_fixes.sh
```

## After Deployment

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
2. Visit https://4dllm.github.io/OceanLifeDemo
3. Check these pages for proper image display:
   - Home page (background image)
   - Fleet page (6 yacht images)
   - Platform page (3 dashboard screenshots)
   - Gallery page (multiple yacht images)

## If Images Still Don't Show

1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check the browser console for any 404 errors
4. Verify the build completed successfully in GitHub Actions

All image paths are now properly configured for the GitHub Pages base URL `/OceanLifeDemo/`.

Happy sailing! ‚öìÔ∏èüõ•Ô∏è
