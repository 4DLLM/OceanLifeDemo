# Image Path Fixes Summary

## Fixed Files

### 1. FleetPage.jsx
- ✅ Added import for `getImagePath` utility
- ✅ Updated all 6 vessel images to use `getImagePath()`:
  - imgi_6_yacht-management-4-1.webp
  - imgi_7_yacht-management-1.webp
  - imgi_8_yacht-management-4.webp
  - imgi_9_yacht-management-2.webp
  - imgi_10_yacht-management-3.webp
  - imgi_11_yacht-management-5.webp

### 2. PlatformPage.jsx
- ✅ Added import for `getImagePath` utility
- ✅ Updated all 3 platform screenshots to use `getImagePath()`:
  - OwnerDashboard.png
  - TechnicianAP.png
  - AdminPortal.png

### 3. AboutPage.jsx
- ✅ Added import for `getImagePath` utility
- ✅ Updated image paths (note: these images may not exist in the gallery):
  - family-photo.jpg
  - HealthDoodles.png

## Already Correct
- ✅ HomePage.jsx - Already using getImagePath
- ✅ GalleryPage.jsx - Already using getImagePath
- ✅ ServicesPage.jsx - Already using getImagePath
- ✅ Header.jsx - Already using getImagePath for logo

## How It Works

The `getImagePath` utility function (in `/src/utils/paths.js`) ensures that all image paths are properly prefixed with the base URL configured in `vite.config.js`. 

For GitHub Pages deployment, the base URL is set to `/OceanLifeDemo/`, which means:
- Local path: `/images/gallery/example.webp`
- Becomes: `/OceanLifeDemo/images/gallery/example.webp`

This ensures images load correctly when the site is hosted at https://4dllm.github.io/OceanLifeDemo/

## Next Steps

1. Run `chmod +x deploy_image_fixes.sh` to make the deploy script executable
2. Run `./deploy_image_fixes.sh` to commit, push, and build the changes
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update
4. Visit https://4dllm.github.io/OceanLifeDemo to verify all images are loading

## Verification

After deployment, check these pages specifically:
- Fleet page - Should show all 6 yacht images
- Platform page - Should show 3 dashboard screenshots
- About page - May show missing image placeholders if images don't exist
