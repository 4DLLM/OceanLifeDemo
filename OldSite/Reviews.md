Truly a great yacht management company.
Game changer for us. I was tired of not getting things done and not being able to fully enjoy our retirement plans. With the OL membership I jump on the service app and simply schedule what we need and it’s just done and when they say it will be done. Truly a great yacht management company.

We are thrilled to have found Ocean Life!
After years of struggling to get prompt, reliable, and satisfactory services for our yacht, we are thrilled to have found Ocean Life! Through their membership program, which provides monthly maintenance, and repairs as needed, we no longer have to worry about having our yacht ready to go when we're ready to go! They also provide an app that makes scheduling a breeze. I highly recommend Ocean Life!

Ocean Life Yacht Services Customer Review
Ocean Life Yacht management offers top of the line solutions for yacht owners. As a Captain, making sure things are working properly is crucial! It’s about time a business came along and offered a full-encompassing service like this: both dependable and on time. The logistics and coordination of getting certain projects done can sometimes be daunting. I for one appreciate how well they can handle all these moving parts. Job well done.
